<p align="center">The Revenants' very own discord bot!</p>


### What is Banshee Bot?
Banshee Bot is a discord bot that provides tools for managing a guild from World of Warcraft.

This bot was built intended for use by the [The Revenants](https://raider.io/guilds/us/dalaran/The%20Revenants) so a majority of the features and customization is related to that guild.


**Planned Features**

- Query RaiderIO for character data directly in discord
- Create rosters to track characters based on discord member roles
- Weekly, monthly and season summary reports for the guild characters

## Example

Once you add the bot to the server you will get a dm. Here I want to have the initial setup workflow but for now that is handled in the discord server.

Next you will need to set the wow guild for the discord server so now all the guild commands will associated with the added guild.

Then you will need to add the wow characters that are in the guild. I hope to make this a role-specific command, where every user with said role sets up their character themselves.

Finally we have the guild summary command which will showcase all the guild details currently being tracked. This is an early iteration of the roster functionality which will allow admins to track specific characters and show a small summary of their stats
